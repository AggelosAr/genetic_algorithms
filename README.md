# genetic_algorithms

This is the solution to some exercices, requesting to simulate the genetic algorithm.
The DRY principle was not followed, since when you inspect the source code you will realize the same function was rewritten 3 times.
The code in all of these functions is identical except one more and two more arguments are passed in each of these function.
Also there are 2 mains. This was not done to make the code harder to read, instead it was an attempt to answer each question 
proposed in the book, separately. Anyway the experiments carried out are according to the guidance of the book.
