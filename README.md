# genetic_algorithms

This is a basic genetic algorithm implementation using multiprocessing in python.
This is the solution to some exercices, requesting to simulate the genetic algorithm.
The experiments carried out are according to the guidance of the book.
Various cases are tested, where the generation numbers, the crossover rate and the mutation probability are changed and the results are observed.
